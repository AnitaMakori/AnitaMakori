I have over 3 years of professional experience as a Health Data Scientist, having collaborated extensively with the WHO Afro regional office, the Kenyan Ministry of Health, and various governmental bodies. My focus has been on providing crucial health-related analytical insights to shape policy and decision-making processes, especially in the context of infectious disease outbreak response.

My expertise lies in the application of evidence-based research to inform and contribute to the control and prevention of infectious diseases. With a strong foundation in epidemiological principles and statistical analysis, I am adept at navigating complex health datasets and conducting comprehensive research to support public health initiatives.
